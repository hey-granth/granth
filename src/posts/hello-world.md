## Who the hell am I?

I’m Granth.  
I build software, break it, rebuild it cleaner, then wonder why I didn’t do it that way the first time.

Professionally, I’m someone who likes systems that **work**, scale, and don’t collapse the moment real users show up. Personally, I’m someone who overthinks life at 2 AM, survives on caffeine and curiosity, and has an unhealthy relationship with the internet.

This blog is my corner of the internet where I stop pretending LinkedIn is a personality.

## The professional version (resume-safe)

I work in backend-heavy engineering land. APIs, databases, async systems, architecture decisions that feel small today but come back to haunt you six months later.

I care about:
- Clean abstractions
- Code that doesn’t age like milk
- Systems that can survive real traffic, not just tutorial-level users
- Understanding *why* something works, not just *that* it works

I don’t romanticize “grind culture.” Shipping matters. Learning matters more. Burning out helps nobody.

If this sounds serious, don’t worry. It gets worse.

## The personal version (human-safe)

Outside work, I’m not “passionate about leveraging synergies.”  
I’m just a guy trying to make sense of things.

I like:
- Late-night walks where my brain refuses to shut up
- Music that hits harder when life feels slightly off
- Memes that are funny because they’re uncomfortably accurate
- Overanalyzing random decisions like they’re system design interviews

I oscillate between:
- “I’ve got my shit together”
- “What the fuck am I doing with my life”

This is normal. If you say it isn’t, you’re lying or selling a course.

## Internet brain rot, but make it self-aware

My personality is basically:
- “This is fine” dog during deadlines  
- “NPC energy” when social batteries die  
- “Main character arc” when a project finally clicks  
- Doomscrolling, but with bookmarks

I believe memes are modern philosophy.  
If you’ve ever learned more from a shitpost than a motivational quote, we’re on the same wavelength.

## Why this blog exists

This blog is not:
- A tutorial dump
- A flex board
- A productivity cult shrine

This blog *is*:
- A record of how I think
- Lessons learned the hard way
- Thoughts on work, life, systems, failure, ambition, and occasionally dumb stuff that still matters

Some posts will be technical.  
Some will be personal.  
Some will be me trying to explain something to myself and accidentally publishing it.

## What you should expect

- Opinions, not absolutes
- Practical thinking over motivational bullshit
- Progress over perfection
- Occasional swearing when it fits the mood

If you’re here to see a perfectly polished professional persona, wrong place.  
If you’re here to read honest thoughts from someone building things, figuring life out, and not pretending it’s all smooth sailing, welcome.

That’s it. No CTA. No hustle pitch. Just me, writing things down before I forget why they mattered.
