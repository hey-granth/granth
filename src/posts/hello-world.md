# Hi, I’m Granth. This Is the Part Where I Pretend to Be Normal.

Welcome to my corner of the internet. This blog exists for two reasons:
1. Recruiters.
2. Me trying to leave a breadcrumb trail explaining who I was at this point in time, in case future-me forgets.

If you’re here for a clean, corporate “About Me” page, wrong tab. If you’re here for something honest, mildly unhinged, and still professional enough to not get me blacklisted, keep reading.

## The Professional Me (Yes, I Do Things)

Professionally, I build software. Mostly backend. Mostly things that break first and work later.

I like systems that:
- Scale without crying
- Fail loudly instead of silently
- Don’t require a 40-page README to run locally

I care about architecture, async workflows, background jobs, APIs that don’t feel like a personal attack, and codebases that don’t rot the moment the original author disappears. I enjoy Django, FastAPI, databases, queues, infra-adjacent problems, and generally asking “what happens when this gets used by real humans at 2 AM?”

I’m not obsessed with frameworks. I’m obsessed with **leverage**. Tools are replaceable. Thinking isn’t.

Career-wise, I’m still early, which means I’m allowed to break things, ask dumb questions, and occasionally ship something surprisingly solid. I take that license seriously.

## The Personal Me (Outside the Commit History)

Outside of work, I’m not “passionate about coding” 24/7. That would be concerning.

I like:
- Internet culture and memes that age like milk
- Overanalyzing life decisions at night like it’s a competitive sport
- Music on loop until it loses all meaning
- Long walks where I pretend I’m the main character in an A24 film

I oscillate between ambition and “what the fuck am I doing with my life” at a frequency that should probably be studied. I’m introspective, occasionally cynical, and deeply allergic to fake motivation content.

I value honesty, competence, curiosity, and people who actually build shit instead of just tweeting about it.

## Meme Philosophy (Very Serious Section)

If memes are modern philosophy, then my belief system looks something like this:

- “This is fine” dog: accurate internal state during deadlines  
- “NPC energy”: what happens when you stop questioning defaults  
- “Bro really thought that would work”: my reaction to most early designs  
- “It compiles, ship it”: forbidden knowledge  
- “We’ll refactor later”: historical lie, documented across civilizations  

Humor is a coping mechanism. So is writing code. Sometimes they overlap.

## What This Blog Will Be About

This blog will not be niche-polished content written to appease algorithms.

It will include:
- Things I’m building and why
- Lessons learned the hard way
- Career thoughts without LinkedIn cringe
- Personal reflections that don’t fit neatly into bullet points
- Occasional rants when something deserves it

Some posts will be technical. Some will be personal. Some will be me yelling into the void in structured Markdown.

## Why This Exists At All

Because clarity compounds.

Writing forces me to slow down, think clearly, and stop bullshitting myself. If it helps someone else along the way, cool. If not, at least it documents the process.

This is not a brand. This is a log.

If you’re reading this years later: hope it worked out.
If you’re reading this now: welcome to the mess.
